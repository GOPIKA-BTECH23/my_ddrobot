# my_ddrobot
A teleop-controlled fire sprinkler AGV robot that allows remote/manual control of a robotic arm and turret, designed for fire suppression applications. Operators can use keyboard commands to position the arm and turret in real time. The system is ROS2-integrated and facilitates safe, responsive actuation for emergency or hazardous environments.

Teleop-Controlled Fire Sprinkler AGV Robot
This project implements a teleoperation system for an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) equipped with a fire sprinkler arm. It allows remote/manual control of the armâ€™s position and turret using keyboard commands.

Features
Remote teleoperation for a fire sprinkler robotic arm

Keyboard controls for two arm links and the turret

ROS 2 integration for real-time command and feedback

Project Structure
teleop_arm_control.py: ROS2 node receiving keyboard input and publishing float commands to arm/turret motors

setup.py: Python setup script for ROS2 packaging and installation

Log files (logger_all.log, events.log): For debugging and recording events

report_ROS.pdf: Detailed technical report

Controls
Arm Link 1:
q: Down
w: Up

Arm Link 2:
a: Down
s: Up

Turret:
z: Left
x: Right

Exit:
CTRL+C

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your_repository_name.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
cd your_repository_name
Install the package using ROS2 tools:

bash
ros2 run myddrobot armturretteleop
Requirements
Python 3

ROS 2 (tested with [choose your distro, e.g., Foxy/Humble])
